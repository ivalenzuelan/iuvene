## 🚀 **New Feature: Image Slider for Products**

Your website now supports **multiple images per product** with a beautiful, interactive image slider! Each product can have multiple photos that customers can browse through.

## 📁 **Updated JSON Structure**

### **Before (Single Image):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Fluid Ring",
  "material": "9K Gold - Sapphire",
  "image": "images/product-fluid-ring.jpg"
}
```

  "images": [
    "images/product-fluid-ring.jpg",
    "images/product-fluid-ring-2.jpg",
    "images/product-fluid-ring-3.jpg"
  ]
}
```

## 🔑 **Key Fields Explained:**

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `image` | **Main/Featured image** - shown in product grid | ✅ Yes |
| `images` | **Array of all product images** - for the slider | ✅ Yes |

## ✨ **How to Add Multiple Images to a Product:**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Images**
1. **Main Image**: Your best/front-facing photo (600x600px recommended)
2. **Additional Images**: Different angles, details, lifestyle shots
3. **Naming Convention**: 
   - `product-name.jpg` (main image)
   - `product-name-2.jpg` (second image)
   - `product-name-3.jpg` (third image)

### **Step 2: Update JSON**
Edit `data/products.json` and add the `images` array:

```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Golden Ocean Necklace",
  "material": "14K Gold",
  "type": "necklaces",
  "category": "gold",
  "image": "images/product-gold-necklace.jpg",
  "images": [
    "images/product-gold-necklace.jpg",
    "images/product-gold-necklace-2.jpg",
    "images/product-gold-necklace-3.jpg"
  ],
  "description": "Beautiful 14K gold necklace inspired by ocean waves..."
}
```

### **Step 3: Save and Test**

```

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**
