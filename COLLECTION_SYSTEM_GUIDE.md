# üéØ Collection System Guide - Iuvene Jewelry

## üöÄ **New Feature: Collection-Based Product Filtering**

Your website now has a **smart collection system** that allows customers to browse products by collections! When someone clicks on a collection, they'll see only the products from that specific collection.

## üìÅ **Updated JSON Structure**

### **Collections Array:**
```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "id": "oceana",
      "name": "Oceana",
      "description": "Inspired by Australia's coastal waters and marine life",
      "image": "images/collection-oceana.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Fluid Ring",
      "collection": "oceana",
      "image": "images/product-fluid-ring.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

|-------|-------------|----------|

## üìù **How to Add New Collections:**

### **Step 1: Add Collection to JSON**
Edit `data/products.json` and add a new collection:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "id": "summer",
      "name": "Summer Collection",
      "description": "Light and airy pieces perfect for warm weather",
      "image": "images/collection-summer.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Step 2: Add Collection Image**
Place your collection image in the `images/` folder:
- `images/collection-summer.jpg`

### **Step 3: Update HTML**
Add the collection card to `index.html`:

```html
<div class="collection-card" data-collection="summer">
    <div class="collection-image">
        <img src="images/collection-summer.jpg" alt="Summer Collection" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="collection-content">
        <h3>Summer Collection</h3>
        <p>Light and airy pieces perfect for warm weather</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **Step 4: Assign Products to Collection**
Update your products to include the collection ID:

```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Summer Breeze Necklace",
  "collection": "summer",
  "image": "images/product-summer-necklace.jpg"
}
```

## üîß **Technical Details:**

### **Collection IDs:**
- **Must match exactly** between collections and products
- **Use lowercase** with hyphens (e.g., "oceana", "everyday", "bespoke")
- **No spaces** in collection IDs

### **Fallback System:**

- **Always shows products** even if collection system fails

### **Performance:**
