## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
3. **Customize** the content, images, and styling as needed

### For Development
1. **Serve locally** using a local server (recommended for service worker functionality)
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
2. **Open** `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
3. **Edit** `data/products.json` to manage products
4. **Add images** to the `images/products/` folder structure

## 🛍️ Managing Products

### Easy Product Management
Products are now managed through a centralized JSON file for maximum flexibility:

### 1. Adding Product Images
```
images/products/your-product-name/
├── main.jpg          # Primary product image
├── angle-1.jpg       # Different viewing angles
├── angle-2.jpg       # Additional angles
├── detail.jpg        # Close-up details
└── lifestyle.jpg     # Product in use
```

### 2. Update Product Database
Edit `data/products.json`:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 7,
      "name": "Your Product Name",
      "material": "14K Gold",
      "price": 299,
      "type": "rings",
      "category": "gold",
      "collection": "everyday",
      "soldOut": false,
      "image": "images/products/your-product-name/main.jpg",
      "images": [
        "images/products/your-product-name/main.jpg",
        "images/products/your-product-name/angle-1.jpg",
        "images/products/your-product-name/detail.jpg"
      ],
      "description": "Beautiful handcrafted ring..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Product Categories
- **Types**: `rings`, `earrings`, `necklaces`, `bangles`
- **Categories**: `gold`, `silver`, `brass`, `gemstone`
- **Collections**: `oceana`, `everyday`, `bespoke`

## Optional: Load products from Google Drive

Let admins upload folders to Google Drive and have the site read them automatically.

Folder structure:
- Collections root folder: subfolders by collection, each containing product folders
  - `CollectionsRoot/`
    - `Oceana/`
      - `Fluid Ring/` -> images inside
    - `Everyday/`
      - `Ripple Ring/` -> images inside
- Non-collections root folder: product folders not belonging to any collection
  - `NonCollectionsRoot/`
    - `Waterway Studs/` -> images inside

Setup steps:
1. Enable Google Drive API and create a Browser API key.
2. Set Drive folders to "Anyone with the link" (Viewer).
3. Get folder IDs from the Drive URLs.
4. Edit `js/content-config.js`:
   - `enabled: true`
   - `apiKey: "YOUR_BROWSER_API_KEY"`
   - Set `rootFolders.collections` and `rootFolders.nonCollections` with your IDs

Notes:
- If Drive is enabled and returns items, it takes priority over `data/products.json`. Otherwise the site falls back automatically.
- Images use Drive thumbnail links for fast loading.

## Customization

- Primary: `#2c2c2c` (Dark Gray)

### Static Hosting (Recommended)

- **Firebase Hosting**: Google's hosting solution

### Deploy to Vercel

This project is a static site; no build step required. A `vercel.json` is included for sensible caching.

Option A — Dashboard (Git-based):
1. Push this project to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Go to Vercel and click “New Project” → Import your repo
3. Framework Preset: “Other” (static)
4. Root Directory: repository root
5. Build & Output Settings: leave empty (no build), Output is the repo root
6. Deploy

Option B — Vercel CLI:
1. Install: `npm i -g vercel`
2. In the project root: `vercel` and follow prompts (set as static)
3. For production: `vercel --prod`

Environment and config:
- Google Drive (optional): edit `js/content-config.js` and commit changes. For advanced setups, you can use Vercel Environment Variables and inject them into `content-config.js` during a simple build step later.
- Caching: `vercel.json` sets long-term caching for assets and no-cache for HTML/JSON.
